# Refactoring Massive View Controllers

> This repo was made while following along with the _Hacking with Swift_ tutorial, ["How to Refactor Massive View Controllers"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/159/how-to-refactor-massive-view-controllers).

Using the provided starter project, I've attempted to break each commit beyond the initial commit into the main checkpoints of the tutorial.
